# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation

This is an example project from the AICore curriculum, intended to teach the basic concepts of data manipulation & give candidates a taste of Data Analytics. The project is composed of milestones to building the functional code, these will be described first, before the full functionality is outlined.

# Milestone 1

Getting everything in place

 - Read source database in RDS
 - Read pdfs with supplementary data
 - Clean incoming data based on context
	 - for this I've created two Jupyter Notebooks to explore the data, try different methods and then apply the most successful into the main codebase
 - Store cleaned data in local postgressql database.
