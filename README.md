# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation

This is an example project from the AICore curriculum, intended to teach the basic concepts of data manipulation & give candidates a taste of Data Analytics. The project is composed of milestones to building the functional code, these will be described first, before the full functionality is outlined.

# Milestones 1 & 2

Getting everything in place

 - Read source database in RDS
 - Read pdfs with supplementary data
 - Clean incoming data based on context
	 - for this I've created Jupyter Notebooks to explore the different data, try different methods and then applied the most successful/relevant into the main codebase
 - Store cleaned data in local postgressql database.

 # Milestones 3 & 4

These were undertaken on a local postgresql server, and so there's very little reflection of them here on github. The steps were as follows:

- Clean SQL tables
	- Specify column types
	- Add keys
	- Add foreign keys

- Query SQL tables
	- the most complex of these queries are saved in big_sql_queries.txt for posterity.
